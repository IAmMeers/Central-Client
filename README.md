# Central Restaurant Management

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Central Restaurant Management is a project our team designed for our database class.  We want this application to be a central management platform for restaurant owners/staff to conduct numerous operations such as managing Store information, store inventory, employee information, and menu items.  The database is designed to support POS operations which may be added in the future.  This means item history is created, tracking the price of items even if they are adjusted in the future.  This allows accurate sales records to be obtained at any point over time.  

The database is designed to follow Boyce Codd Normal Form.

NOTE: This repo is for the front-end platform, created with React.  The backend is currently not running on Heroku due to platform costs so the website link does not work properly.
